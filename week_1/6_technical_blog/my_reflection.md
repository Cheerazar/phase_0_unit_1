	Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

		Writing this blog post was very enjoyable. I just committed the file a few minutes ago, so I haven't gotten any views or comments yet. Having a defined topic and writing about it was quite useful, but I would say the more useful aspect was creating the blog template and making sure that it functioned properly. Once I posted what I thought to be my final product and I checked it out on GitHub, I discovered that my background image wasn't part of my committed repository. Without thinking I had just moved it from one directory to another, forgetting the fact that it was part of a version controlled repository... Whoops! Since then I've re-added the file to my repository in the new location, but I need to clean up the missing file in the old location.

		The assignment wasn't cumbersome. Most of my layout work had been accomplished in the previous challange, so it was a matter of creating some new files, adding the template structure, cleaning things up, and then adding those files to the repository. I felt best about the layout of the blog template, while I'm never that certain about my writing, be it the content or the style. Things came together well and I'm quite satisfied with the final product.
