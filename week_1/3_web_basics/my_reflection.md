DNS - Domain Name System.

	<p class="question1">
		It was fascinating to gain a greater understanding of the DNS, Domain Name System, and how it functions. The fact that there are name servers sitting out there acting like phone books, such that people can use friendly website names instead of remember IP addresses was fascinating to read. Also discovering that there is such a things as the "dreaded DNS delay" and then getting a comprehensive explanation as to how and why it occurs was very informative. Isolating parts of the DNS delay to the caching property known as TTL (time to live) of website translations was news to me.

	<p class="question2">
		One of the important things to remember about setting up your HTML site is to make sure that your HTML element tags are properly closed on your page. Otherwise you'll end up with some very odd looking sections within your pages. You'll also want to consider whether you are building a website or a web application. One of the primary differences being whether or not the site is static or frequently updating. A static website would be one such as restaurant's menu page, as they tend not to change all that frequently. A web application on the other hand frequently undergoes changes or updates, such as a blog or Amazon.com. Typically when building a website, you can construct it with just HTML and CSS as well as a little bit of JavaScript if required. While on the other hand you could end up using some combination of the following languages to make an interactive and responsive website: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Django, and Meteor.

		Confident. After seeing my website where I expected it to be, I was more confident in my understanding of git and GitHub. I've worked on other projects on my local machine before, but this was the first one that I've posted to GitHub in such a manner. I'm looking forward to creating more pages as the class moves forward.

	<p class="question4">
		The explanation of the Internet versus the Web helped remind me of previous readings I had completed on the topic. This helped further solidify the fact that the Internet is the underlying architecture of networked computers, which use a set of defined protocols to communicate. Whereas the Web is essentially the window dressing to the Internet, allowing users to see what the Internet is holding by using various web browsers to render the content.

		I did not use any additional resources for this particular challange.
