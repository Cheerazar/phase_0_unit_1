Hello Ian, Igor, and Jessica,

My name is Gunnari and I am currently joining you from Boston. I'll be heading out to San Francisco at the end of June to get settled in prior to class getting started. I'm looking forward to working with all of you over the next couple of weeks. There are so many things to learn from all over the place, that I'm sure we can help each other pick things up as we go. This is a very exciting time!

I tend to spend way too much time on Facebook. A few other sites that I enjoy are MacRumors and Reddit.

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

It's reassuring to know that people have the the same or similar fears as I do about going to DBC and San Francisco. Is it the right decision? Am I going to succeed? Do I need to worry about things at home? We're all in this boat together and we can all help one another succeed as we tackle this incredibly ambitious project.  

This week has been long but very rewarding. There is so much to learn. I'm more sure of my decision to enroll at DBC the further into the preparation I get. I am very much looking forward to taking a break in a few minutes and putting my feet up for the night, before getting back to the grindstone tomorrow.
