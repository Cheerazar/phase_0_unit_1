	<p class="question1">
		One of the primary things that I learned from this experience is that there is a lot of thought and consideration that goes into design and the user experience that I didn't know about. I had a rough idea of what goes on during that process, but after completing the reading associated with the design process, I realize that in reality I had no idea. There are so many pieces that have to be considered and many approaches that can be used to complete those pieces.
	</p>

	<p class="question2">
		So far I have enjoyed my limited forays design and user experience. There is a lot to take in with all of the information presented, but it's all quite fascinating. I enjoyed working on my site quite a bit. It's a bit rudimentary right now, but I know that it will improve over time as I get more and more familiar with all of the pieces. I can't remember who said it earlier this week, but it's not as if a site is ever truly done, so I'll always be able to play around and tweak things.
	</p>

	<p class="question3">
		The resources provided in this challenge gave me enough information to successfully complete it without having to look anywhere else.
	</p>

	<p class="question4">
		I didn't really have any problems with the concepts. It will just require a bit more repetition to get wireframing down better and to also incorporate some software to make things easier on myself. 
	</p>

	<p class="question5">
		This entire challenge was a lesson in new skills and tricks! I can tell that I'll be coming back to wireframing quite a bit in the future. It's a fascinating subject and I really want to be able to give users of my future sites a positive experience. After all I want them to come back and keep using my site!
	</p>

	<p class="question6">
		I'm quite confident that I understand the concepts laid out in this challenge. They will get easier with more repetition, which I'm sure I will get in the coming weeks through challenges or any extra studying that I can squek in when possible.
	</p>

	<p class="question7">
		I enjoyed all parts of this challenge. I'll need to work with a wireframing program to ease the struggles I encountered while laying out complex pages by hand. 
	</p>

	<p class="question8">
		While I enjoyed the experience of wireframing the sites I had chosen, doing it by hand was extremely tedious for me. I might have chosen complex pages to wireframe or there's also the chance that since I'm new to the concept that I will speed up and improve over time. There's also the chance that using wireframing software will make it more enjoyable for me to do. I can see the benefit of doing a quick wireframe sketch of a page, but doing the complex layouts by hand is for the birds!
