<div class="questions">
	<p class="question1">
		One of the main questions was how to create a sidebar, floated to the left, that spanned the entire height of a page, such that I could float the content area against the right hand side of that to center it in the page. I couldn't find a simple solution, so I ended up making the sidebar go from the top of the page to the bottom to allow the rest of the content area to neatly line up against its edge. Most of the other problems that I ran into throughout the challenge were solved via some experimentation, which was then followed by some tweaking to get things to line up better.

	<p class="question2">
		Overall the concepts made a lot of sense to me, it was just the nitty gritty details of implementing them properly. The resources that were provided really helped demonstrate and explain the concepts that were required within the challenge. The one thing that I couldn't figure out easily was how to vertically center my h1 text within my header.

	<p class="question3">
		Almost all of the CSS techniques were new to me. The pseudoselectors associated with the anchor elements are terrific. It was also fascinating to see how much the setup of the CSS selectors mattered. There was a period where I couldn't get something to work because a <code>.container > div</code> was overriding what was in a <code>.nav</code> selector. Throughout this entire challenge my understanding of CSS for layout has increased and it is making more and more sense. There's a world of things that I still don't know about CSS, but I'm learning more and more with each challenge!

	<p class="question4">
		Provided that I don't need to get everything with my first attempt, I'm quite confident with my comprehension of the learning objectives contained within this challenge. With a little bit of time and experimentation each of the concepts can be put down onto a page. I'm sure that the more and more pages that I make, the more intuitive the layout process will become as well as my understanding of CSS.
	</p>

	<p class="question5">
		This entire challenge was quite enjoyable. There were certainly moments of hair-pulling frustration after I reloaded a page only to see my perfectly laid out page crumble with one CSS change. Though each of those frustrations turned into a learning opportunity. As I was working towards the end of the challenge there was a smile on my face as I tried the last few tweaks and eventually got the last piece to fall into place.
	</p>

	<p class="question6">
		I don't know if I really found any part of the challenge tedious, but there were certainly frustrating moments. Primarily my frustration was in trying to get my sidebar height to go the entire width of the page, such that my floated <code>.container</code> div contents would still be centered in my pages overall width. Early I had managed to center that div without having it floated left, but then I realized the challenge required me to do so. In the end it wasn't a huge problem, but there were certainly some comical moments with my arms up in the air going "Why is that over there now and not where I expected it to be?!" moments.
