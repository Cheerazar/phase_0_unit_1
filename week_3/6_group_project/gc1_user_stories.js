// My role in the group is:
// Translate tests into user stories.


// Here is my part of the challenge:

/**
 *
 * Story 1
 * I want to be able to take a group of numbers and add them all together with a program named sum.
 * sum should work with any amount of numbers. sum should provide me with the result after completing.
 * 
 */


/**
 * Story 2
 * I want to be able to get the average of a group of numbers with a program named mean.
 * mean should work with any amount of numbers. mean should provide me with the result after completing.
 * 
 */

/**
 * Story 3
 * I want to be able to find the value directly in the middle of a group of numbers with a program named median.
 * median should work with any amount of numbers, either an even or odd amount.
 * median should provide me with the result after completing.

// Reflection

/**
 * What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
 *
 * In the end all parts of my strategy worked. The JavaScript functions that I described in user
 * stories were translated very well into pseudocode, code, and refactored code. Finally they were
 * run through the tests and passed successfully. 
 *
 * The problem that I ran into was trying to describe what the function was supposed to do without
 * getting too technical. It was difficult to not use words like array while writing the user stories.
 * 
 *
 * 
 * What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
 *
 * I didn't do any coding in this challenge, so I didn't have any questions there.
 *
 *
 * 
 * What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
 *
 * I didn't have any trouble with the concepts as I was writing the user stories, nor looking at 
 * the final code. The functions that I created my stories from were easy to understand. 
 *
 *
 * 
 * Did you learn any new skills or tricks? 
 *
 * I didn't really learn any new skills or tricks with this challenge.
 *
 * 
 * 
 * How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
 *
 * I am very confident in the Learning Competencies for this challenge.
 * 
 *
 * 
 * Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
 *
 * I enjoyed seeing that my teammates were able to interpret my user stories and create working
 * code. That was quite rewarding.
 *
 *
 * 
 * Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
 *
 * This was a rather bland challenge for me. The user stories weren't that difficult to create.
 * Nothing was tedious in this challenge. I just didn't really benefit from this particular 
 * challenge. As the person who wrote the user stories I had the easiest job. Running the 
 * tests through node isn't hard if the code works. Maybe it would have been more difficult
 * if things hadn't run smoothly.
