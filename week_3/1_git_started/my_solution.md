## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add
Add the current content found in your working tree. The add command can be used multiple times before a commit. The add command adds the current content at the time the command is issued, therefore if addition content is added to the same file after the first add command, a subsequent add command will need to be run to have the new information added to the repository snapshot during the next commit. 


#### branch
The branch command can perform several functions depending on what option flags are used. 

#### checkout
<!-- Your defnition here -->

#### clone
<!-- Your defnition here -->

#### commit
<!-- Your defnition here -->

#### fetch
<!-- Your defnition here -->

#### log
The log command will show you a history of commits made in the current repository. 

#### merge
The merge command will incorporate the changes from two branches, since they seperated, into the current branch. The command will compare the two branches to see how they have diverged, it will then output a log message that details the changes along with the names of the two parent commits. 

#### pull
The pull command fetches changes from either a remote repository or a local branch and merges them into your current branch. 

#### push
The push command updates your remote repository with the changes that you have committed to your local repository. 

#### reset
<!-- Your defnition here -->

#### rm
The rm command removes files from a git repository. 

#### status
The status command will tell you the differences in your repository since your last commit. It does this by indicating the differences in files already tracked by git in your repository since your last commit and also shows content in your repository that is not tracked by git.
