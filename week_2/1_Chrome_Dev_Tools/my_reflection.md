			The Document Object Model (DOM) is the structural model used within HTML documents that results in the visual presentation of a webpage. The DOM is a tree like structure where objects can be added where needed that represent components on the screen. 
		</p>

			The DOM makes a lot of sense to me. As of the moment it seems like a neatly organized cross-browser language independent way of representing what is going on on a webpage. It is laid out in a tree like structure with various nodes being added or removed when needed to create a pages structure. You can manipulate nodes on a page by using their identifiers, classes or ids, or you can use pseudoclass selectors like child, last-child, first, last, etc.

			Using the Chrome Dev Tools Elements tool to spiff up my site allowed me to make some basic but functional improvements. I was unable to make small modifications here and there to make it look a little bit better, but the changes that I could make there in no way compares to what you is already present in a wordpress blog page. I really like that the dev tools will put colored blocks over the elements to show the size of the element, padding, border, and margins. As this can help you troubleshoot certain things much more easily. Also the little block diagram at the foot of the CSS section for individual elements is terrific!

		<p>
			The wordpress pages that I experimented with are already quite polished looking. I was able to experiement with them to make changes to see how their CSS had moved margins or to see why they had used a certain CSS property. It's incredibly useful to be able find a page you like the layout of and to then be able to open up the CSS that made it look like that to play around with. The learning opportunities are incredibly valuable.

		<p>
			The Chrome Dev Tools are extremely useful and easy to use to me. They have lots of features that allow me to experiement with my page and to debug things when there are issues. I've used them in the past to debug pages I've been working on and to figure, where CSS problems and networking problems were occuring. I'm looking forward to getting into to experiment more with the optimization features in the near future.

		<p>
			Overall there were a lot of solidifying moments as I was reminded of various features that are available in the Chrome Dev Tools. Being required to experiment with various pieces again has been really helpful and taking the Code School course again helped remind me of various features as well as firm up my understanding of others.

			I used the wiki for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a> to gain a greater understanding.
