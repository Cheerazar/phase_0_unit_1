* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?

<section>
	Web standards are terrific and essential to ensure that the web operates smoothly as it changes and grows over the years. If everyone did whatever they wanted to you could have even more webpages than now that don't behave the same way across all browsers.

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?

<section>
	The standard web structure does make sense. It seems natural and intuitive as the more I work with it and while I'm not incredibly familiar with it yet, with practice it will become second nature. 
</section>

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

<section>
	Yes I do like those HTML5 elements. It helps to clearly deliniate what you are doing in a certain area, without needing to create a lot of divs.
</section>

* Why is reset.css necessary? 

<section>
	It helps to normalize each web browsers own default behaviors, which are not standard from browser to browser. When your page first loads you want it to look the same as close as possible across all browsers. reset.css helps assist in this goal. 
</section>

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

<section>
	I've used Netscape, Firefox, IE (almost all versions), Chrome, and Safari. When I was working on older computers I would notice a large difference between some pages I would look at when at work and when I was looking at them at home. One of the biggest differences came about when I was using IE6 at work and Firefox at home. The web had matured a lot from the point that IE6 had originally been created, so it was amazing the differences that I would see the same page at hoem and at work.

	I think that it's great that there are multiple browsers out there, but I really wish that they all shared an agreed upon basic standard. It's ridiculous to me that different browsers have different names for the same CSS properties. Why do something like that? What's the point?

	Someone posted a very helpful <a href="http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/using-font-face/">article</a> on @font-face that helped me figure a problem out.
