* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

Responsive web design is the practice of creating a enjoyable viewing experience of a website across a variety of devices and screen sizes. This is critical in web design today, as the number of available devices and resolutions is quite large and still seems to be increasing. 

I am fascinated by responsive web design. It is amazing to see how a webpage can be maniupulated to create a wonderful experience no matter what the display size is on the device being used to interact with a webpage. While it will take longer to create a website that has a responsive design, it seems to be much easier to maintain after the initial effort, as you don't have an entirely seperate site for mobile. Additionally as more and more devices come onto the market, the idea of creating a unique page for each screen size seems ridiculous and entirely unpractical. 

I think that it is a wonderful practice that will make any site that it is implemented on even more enjoyable and reaching than your standard page. Working through manipulating the "Women in Computing" page, I did think that it would be much easier to build a responsive site with that setup in mind, rather than trying to patch it onto something after the fact. I'm looking forward to implementing it in pages that I work on in the future!

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

Before you would design one website that everyone used. After smartphones came out you had to start thinking about adding a mobile version of your website, as a normal website is very hard to view on such a small screen. Then to further complicate things the mobile phone market exploded with different sized displays, which were then quickly followed by tablets of all shapes and sizes. With all of the different screen size options it then became impractical to design and optimize a different mobile site for each resolution available. Responsive web design seems to be the current answer to this particular problem and seems like it will be a solid answer for at least a few years. 

Technology is changing so rapidly right now that it is incredibly hard to predict what will be needed in the future. It is likely that appliances in the home will become more and more connected to the internet, which will result in a lot of potential applications. Tell the tablet in your kitchen island what ingredients you have and it will return a dish for you. Predictive applications that will send your phone a status alert in the morning to remind you to bring an umbrella, because there is a high chance of rain during your normal commute home.

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

Honestly I'm not entirely certain how they interact with the web. I know that some people are able to use screen readers to browse a webpage, which is why it is important to properly outline your website. Yes, we should take the visually impaired into account when designing and developing as they're people just like everyone else. It might get complicated if it will take an extra month to incorporate those designs and the customer doesn't want to pay for those considerations.

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

One of the biggest points I've taken home so far is that before you start coding up a website, even if it is simple, that it is a good practice to take the time to create a wireframe for your site. This creates a reference for you to refer to when you to refer to during the coding process and it also gives you the chance to design the minimum viable product that you need. During the initial wireframe process you can create a second wireframe that has more of the nice to have features, but aren't required to deliver the product and if you have time you can work on those as well. 

As of the moment there doesn't really seem to be anything that is stupid or not making sense. There are merely some things that I need to spend more time looking at to understand them more in depth than I already do.

I did not look for any additionaly resources for this particular challenge. The articles that were provided gave me plenty of information to start exploring responsive web design.
