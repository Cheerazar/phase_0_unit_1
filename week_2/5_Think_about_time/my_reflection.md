* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 

Looking over Phase 0 my biggest time management challenge will be to make sure that I do not underestimate how much time I will need to complete a the challenges each week. During the first week I started a couple of days late to catch up with the pre phase 0 work I needed to complete, and as I was working on the challenge material I realized that I was going to need more time than I had anticipated. While everything came together in the end there were certainly some moments on Saturday and Sunday, where little bits of fear kept creeping in about not finishing the first assignment on time. After that experience I realized I would need to be much better regarding time budgeting. 

* How will you combat that?

Looking over and reading through each challenge each week and sketching out the amount of time I think each challenge will take will be helpful. This will let me know which challenges are technical, reading/reflection oriented, combinations, and if there are concepts that I've never heard of before. From there I will try to map out what I'll be working on each day and have a rough goal of what I'd like to accomplish. The critical point about this approach though is to not beat myself up if I do not hit my goals. Yes they're goals and I'd like to achieve them, but at the same time complications may come up and I won't get to it in the time frame that I thought I would and I need to know that's ok.  

Also I need to improve my focus as the phase progresses and the work gets harder. This is a huge decision for all of us and I'm sure the rest of you will agree that you want to put your best foot forward as often as you can. 

* What techniques will you try?

Having finished the articles that are part of week 2 challenge 5, there were a couple of different techniques that resonated with me, as I read about them, that I plan on implementing in my work routine. The article about meditation really seemed to be written right at me. I will now be implementing meditation into my work flow. Ideally I would like to work two to four ten to twenty minute meditations into my day. The goal is to meditate before work in the morning, afternoon, and evening, and hopefully after the days work to unwind.

Based on the reading, meditation is said to assist you become more focused and more balanced overall. Having a rough idea of all the stresses that we will be experiencing throughout the next eighteen weeks or so, the idea of having less anxiety, more compassion, better memory, less stress, and more gray matter sounds almost too good to be true. The article has a link to a starting meditation application and I'll start looking at that tonight. 

There was another couple of concepts that pulled out to me I came across them in the material from this week. The idea of starting smaller, but creating a Minimum Viable Product sounded great to me for this type of program. Instead of designing a grandiose site that I end up not being able to implement in time, I will instead scale down my design and create the minimum viable product and then improve it from there. That way I will have a working product, which may lack some bells and whistles initially, but I will be able to add them later. I've had too many instances in the past where I have had these grand visions of what I want something to be, then I get frustrated as all the pieces take too long to build or are so complicated that I can't build them, and then finally I give up as I can't handle all of the failure associated with the design that was just too big for me at the time. 

Lastly I will work without distractions for set periods of time, 25-45 minutes, and then reward myself with a five or ten minute timed break. I've used this technique before with great success, as it lets me focus entirely on my work for a set time, because I know that I will get a break. Also I don't feel compelled to keep working until I'm done with something. If I'm in a flow state that's one thing, but if I'm not, continuing to work with no breaks and "punishing" myself until I finish is not productive. 

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

My overall plan for Phase 0 is to work on implementing the above techniques into my work flow. When Phase 1 starts, I would like to be doing two to four meditations a day and if they're only two to five minutes each, that's perfectly fine. Also getting better at time estimation and breaking down challenges into pieces will be a vital piece of DBC and the work world in general. This is all incredibly exciting to me and I'm looking forward to helping shape myself into a more balanced and productive individual :D
