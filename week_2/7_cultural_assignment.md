# U1.W2: Cultural Assignment

## Learning Competencies
- Practice sharing vulnerability with the people in your cohort
- Identify your biggest fear
- Describe what you would tell your friend if they shared a fear with you. 

## Release 0: Consider the question: 
**What scares you the most about being at DBC?**

The uncertainty of whether or not I have made the correct decision and also the fear of failure.


## Release 1: Email your cohort
Write an email to your cohort using your local cohort mailing list (available on your cohort page in Socrates under the name) that answers this question. Use the subject "Cultural Assignment" if you are the first person. Everyone should reply to the original thread. 
If you are the second or later, be sure to **REPLY ALL** with your response. Be sure to do this by **Wednesday**. 

Hello All!

I hope this finds you all rested after week 1 and ready to take on the new challenges in week 2. Luckily we get to start this week off by letting everyone in the cohort know what our greatest fear is about being at DBC. That's not daunting at all right... >.>?

Well I'll start us off this time. My greatest fear about being at DBC revolves around the central question of, did I make the right decision? The uncertainty associated with this decision is extremely high for me. Am I going to be able to succeed at DBC? Will I be able to handle the work load along with the pressure and the hours? Can I really afford to spend that much money?! Is this really the right career track for me? I needed to make a shift in my career path, as my pervious job was slowly sucking the life out of me. Now that I'm here in DBC I'm extremely excited to be here, but self-doubt regarding my decision creeps in here and there. 

Have a great week fellow Mule Deer and I'm looking forward to working with all of you in the coming weeks.


## Release 2: Reply to your cohort-mates
Starting **Thursday**, take a look at your cohort-mates responses and choose one to respond to. Pretend your best friend is saying that to you. How would you respond? Make sure to direct your response to that person. Reply all to the original thread with your response. 

To all: 

Thank you so much for sharing your fears. It has been reassuring to many people, myself included, to see that most people have similar insecurities, except for maybe Stephens! Starting to work on our open and honest communication at this stage seems to be very beneficial and I'm looking forward to continuing the practice throughout our time at DBC. 

One thread I noticed in a lot of responses has been "What have I done and how could I leave behind the job that was paying me?". In my case, I had to stop doing what I was doing even though it paid well, because I had exceptionally low job satisfaction. While work doesn't necessarily have to be something that you love doing, it certainly helps if you enjoy it and find it mentally stimulating. I'm sure that almost everyone here is searching for that something that will make work more enjoyable and rewarding to them. One thing to remember is that even if this doesn't pan out to be exactly what you expected, the experience gained from this venture will be able to be turned into something positive. This experience will be insanely intense, but the end result will be something we can all be proud of completing. 

The further we get into the prep work the more excited I am to be at DBC and especially with all with all of you :)

	Hello everyone!

I have a wide range of fears concerning DBC that seem to come and go depending on my current level of confidence and plans for the future.

I’m afraid of the intensity of the program and worried I won’t have the character or discipline required to get 100% of the benefit, which seems to require throwing away life-balance and spending all day and night at DBC.

I’m worried about graduating and getting a job as “junior”. I’ve been lucky enough to have a fair amount of responsibility and ownership of my work, and I understand that switching job titles (not careers, in my case) means I’ll probably end up lower on the totem poll. One step backward, two steps forward. I’m afraid of the steps backward. 

I’m worried that I’ll get a real software job to pay the bills and not have the time or energy for entrepreneurial efforts, which is my true passion.  

And I’m worried that I’ll graduate and still not be able to build the app I want to make.

To Cassidy Clawson:

Hello there!

Dev Bootcamp accepted your application for several reasons; one of those reasons being that they know that you have the character to succeed in their program. They clearly saw a characteristic or characteristics in you during the interview process that indicated to them that you would fit in with their approach. Take comfort in that information and have confidence in yourself.

DBC sounds like it will be tough to get a good work/life balance. When you need to set boundaries between the two, be gentle but firm and you will quickly find the right balance that will work for yourself, as well as enable you to assist your cohort mates in the best possible manner. This balance is important, so make sure you find an acceptable balance for yourself. 

While taking a step back in a career is never easy, that step back will result with you having a more fulfilling job moving forward. Your previous job experience will aid you immensely as a start your new job. You'll be rapidly gaining skills as a developer and in addition to that you'll be able to leverage all of your previous experience to catapult yourself up the ranks. Even if you spend a little bit of time lower down, you should be able to rapidly climb the ladder with the combination of both skill-sets at your disposal. 

Once you have graduated from Dev Bootcamp, even if you cannot make the app that you want to immediately, you will have gained a permanent skill set enabling you to obtain the skills you will need to make it a reality. Remember it is less about the specific languages that you will be learning at DBC, but the skills to quickly pick things up and start to use them. Your app might suffer a little delay in production, but you will be able to finish it with the skill-set you gain at DBC.

Best of luck, you're going to do great there. 

Gunnari
