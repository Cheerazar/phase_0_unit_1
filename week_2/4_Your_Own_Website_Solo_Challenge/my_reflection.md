My Website url: cheerazar.github.io

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.



* What did you learn about design and user experience? 

That I should have given myself more time for this particular endeavor. Design and user experience are critical aspects of web design. The fact that a relatively simple form change increased revenue for a company by $300 million over one year is mind boggling. Also the presentation about Etsy redesigning or reexamining their page was also quite insightful. These aspects of design are tantamount to creating a successful and engaging experience for users, which will allow you to obtain additional work. 

 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

This experience was a lot of fun. Working on the wireframe using Mockingbird was very gratifying, and seeing complete image after it got exported was wonderful. Working on the site, coding it up, and seeing it come together was also quite rewarding. It is amazing to see something you thought up, sketched out, wireframed up, and coded up come to life. 


* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

First I started with a couple of quick pen and paper sketches and then I transferred that design to a wireframe in Mockingbird. Following that I started with a basic HTML outline and added the code and structure for each element. If things weren't exactly where I wanted them to be I tweaked them until I got them into place. 


* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

Make smaller social media icons and fix the spacing on the h2 elements in the nav section.  50px sounded like a good idea late at night, and I think they're a tad too large at this point. I'd like to improve the layout to include a few more features. I'd like to make the page responsive, using a responsive grid, to give it some versatility. It would be nice to add some SVG elements to the page like a logo. I'd also like to have the most recent articles from each section on the main page with links to other articles. 


* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

It wasn't that difficult to implement things on this page, but I do wish that I had more time this week to add some more features. As it's an ongoing project though, those additional features will come about soon enough. 

The one thing I was confused on was in the challenge it said to add a plan to your my_wireframe.html page and I took that to mean that I needed to add my wireframe, as I didn't know what other plan there was to add. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

No I used the plentiful resources that were provided to work on my design and layout.
